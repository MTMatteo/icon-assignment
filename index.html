  <h4> Coney Island Creek is a major greenspace and recreational area. It is also dangerously toxic from decades worth of pollution.  </h3>

  <p> Residents use Coney Island Creek for swimming, boating, fishing, and even in religious ceremonies. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently completed testing on pollution levels in the creek. These tests found that decades worth of pollution is still in the water. The creek is now being considered for Superfund status. If granted this status, the EPA will start a cleanup process. Coney Island Creek wouldn’t be the first Superfund site in New York City. In 2020, the EPA began cleanup operations on the Gowanus Canal.</p>

  <p>What follows is not a full list of contaminants in Coney Island Creek. A full list is available in a <a href="https://semspub.epa.gov/work/02/628206.pdf"> comprehensive report from the EPA.</a> This list just connects  pollutants that the EPA found in the creek to industry and human activity in and around Coney Island.

        <p> 1. Coney Island once played host to a site that manufactured and stored gasoline. The Brooklyn Borough Gas Works was in operation from the years 1908-1966 and would regularly leak gas and gas byproducts into the nearby water system. These byproducts are known as Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) and are carcinogenic. Although an effort was made to clean the site in 2012, samples taken in 2021 still show concerning PAH levels in the creek.

      <p> 2. EPA testing found high amounts of chromium-6 and aniline in both the water and soil samples from Coney Island Creek. These two highly toxic chemicals were common in industrial manufacturing, specifically for fabric and dyes. The Brooklyn Yarn and Dye company had long operated in the area and was known to dump waste into the creek which would allegedly dye the creek water different colors. Exposure to chromium-6 damages the respiratory system if inhaled, and the kidneys and liver if injested.

      <p> 3. In 2016, an apartment complex on the Gravesend side of Coney Island Creek was fined for an illegal hookup from their sewer lines that had an outfall into the creek. Beach Haven Apartments was found dumping almost 200,000 gallons of untreated sewage, directly into the waterbody, on a daily basis. It’s unknown how long this was happening before the city stepped in. This is also not the first illegal sewage hookup found connected to the waterways around Coney Island Creek.

      <p> 4. The NYC Environmental Development Corporation (EDC) wants to bring a ferry to Coney Island to help cut down on commuting times to Manhattan. EDC wants to put the ferry stop in the natural harbor of Coney Island Creek. In order to do so, a few feet of sediment would need to be removed so the ferries won’t run aground. Residents are concerned this dredging will stir up long-settled contaminants and release them back into both the water and air.
